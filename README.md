Grade 11 CS, tried to make a neural network in python with pytorch. it didnt really work tbh.
To all the photographers I SWEAR im not evil or would use this for anything bad...
theres other already good tools that could do the same thing but 10x better
just a fun idea for my first serious ML project 
I tried an autoencoder network, but lots of compression atrifacts remain and image looks blurry. But I mean hey, technically that does make a watermark harder to distinguish.
In the future I want to try diffusion and GAN's.
